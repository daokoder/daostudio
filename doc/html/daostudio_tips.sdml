<title>Some tips of using Dao Studio</title>

<===>Vertical arranging of the code editor, script console and data browser</===>

The code editor, script console and data browser are splitted
vertically in the same window. Mouse click on any of them will
maximize the clicked widget and minimize the others.
If the user wants to disable this feature,
the manual splitting button (with up and down arrows near to a hand) 
in the tool bar must be pressed down.

<===>Automatic word completion in code editor or console:</===>

Inside the code editor or console, whenever the user types
an identifier, the software will propose upto 3 words that
matching the typed letters. Then the user can type
CTRL + J, K, L, to complete the unfinished identifier with the first,
second and third proposed word respectively.
Typing the tabular key will complete with the first propsed word.


Currently words corresponding to names of classes, functions, 
global constants and variables can be completed in this way.


<===>Browsing command history in console</===>

The previously input scripts in the console can be browsed and retrived
by using up and down keys.

<===>Multiple line commands in console</===>

In the console, when the return key is pressed, normally, 
the scripts in the command line will be sent to the console to execute.
However, if there is an unclosed (not paired) left braces, 
brackets or squared brackets, the input will be expanded to an extra line
to allow typing unfinished scripts.


So the simplest way to type multiple lines of scripts in the console is to
type a left brace first, and type a block of scripts, 
then type a right brace before entring the scripts.

<===>Other usage of the console</===>

<list>
--Print the value of an expression: <it>(dao) = expression</it>
--Execute a Dao script: <it>(dao) \\script_file_name.dao </it>
--Execute a shell command: <it>(dao) \\command </it>
</list>

<===>Set and unset break points for debugging</===>

Right click on a line number will popup a menu to set or unset a break point.
Break points set on lines without codes will be ignored.
The program will enter debugging mode after execution the line with break point.
Resuming of the program will start with the next line.

<===>Reset execution point during debugging</===>

During debugging, right click on a line number inside the 
current function being executed will popup a menu with extra option
to set the execution point at the current line.
When the execution of the program is resumed, the execution will start
from the new execution point.

<===>Edit and continue during debugging</===>

Edit&Continue is an advanced feature of Dao Studio,
which allows the user to modify the sources and then execute it
without restart the program from the beginning.


When a program is run inside Dao Studio in debugging mode,
the source codes can be modified during the pause by a break point.
Such modification is limited inside the current function
where the program is paused.


After modification, if the execution point is after the modification positions,
the execution point will be automatically set to the first modified line.
The execution point can also be set manually by right click the mouse on
a line number.


When the user click the debugging button to resume the program,
the modified function will be re-compiled, and the execution
will be started from the new execution point.
Some of the values of local variables will be reused whenever possible.


<===>Data browsing and modification</===>

The main entry to data browsing is listed as "Data List"
inside the left panel. Normally only the namespace of the script console
is listed there, but during program debugging, the executing virtual
process will also be listed there.


If the user clicks on the namespace or process entry, 
the data object of the clicked entity will be displayed in the data browser,
the basic information and value of the data object is display in the left side.
If the data object is of a basic data type, its value can be modified there.
And if it is an aggregated type such as list, map, function or class instance etc.,
its components will be displayed as tables in the right side.


Then the user can click on one of the data components,
the clicked one will be added onto the "Data List" in the left panel.
The "Data List" is actually organized as a stack:
click on a data component from the data browser will push the data component
onto the stack;
and click on one item inside the stack will erase all the items above it.
