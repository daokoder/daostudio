/* DaoLateDeleter holds types that are deleted but not really freed.
   This is to provide safety for caching of type matching results.

   When a DaoType object is no longer used, this object is deleted
   from Dao running time system. The data held by this object is
   cleared, but the piece of memory pointed by this object is NOT
   freed immediately. Because if it is freed, it might be allocated
   as another DaoType object with the same address, which is still
   referred to by type matching caches. The reuse of the same memory
   address for two different DaoType objects will clearly invalidate
   the previous caching results! (The same for DaoRoutine/DaoFunction)

   So to be safe, the memory address of a deleted DaoType objects
   will be reserved for some time. The reserved addresses with un-freed
   memory are stored in DaoLateDeleter.

   In each garbage collection cycle, the collector will check how many 
   dead DaoType objects are produced. When there are too many, it will
   change DaoLateDeleter::safe to false, so that when type matching caches
   detect DaoLateDeleter::safe to be false, they will clear their own 
   caches, perform no caching until DaoLateDeleter::safe is set to true. 

   To avoid using mutex lock for type matching caches, the following
   protection algorithm will be used:
   1. GC Cycle I, DaoLateDeleter::types more than N:
   DaoLateDeleter::safe = false;
   DaoLateDeleter::lock = false;
   DaoLateDeleter::version += 1;

   2. GC Cycle I+1, ::safe == false, ::lock = false:
   DaoLateDeleter::lock = true;
   Clear DaoLateDeleter::types;

   3. GC Cycle I+2, ::safe == false, ::lock = true:
   DaoLateDeleter::safe = true;
   DaoLateDeleter::lock = false;

   Since these operations are done in different GC cyles, type matching
   caches are safe to use DaoLateDeleter::safe only to properly take action.
